## Research Question 1:




















## Research Question 2: How do aspects in the personal profile indicated by gender, education, marital status, and age in this dataset individually determine the number of months for payment delay?

###### There are four sub-questions that can be addressed to explore the research question.
###  1. Which category in the sex group affects the length of payment delay the most?

- The categorical plot above shows each gender’s proportion in each month’s repayment status. Female clients have a larger proportion than male clients in the “-2”, “-1”, and “0” ranges which means they pay back on time. And male clients have a slightly larger proportion than female clients in delaying more than three months or above and sometimes leading the whole percentage.

### 2. How is the feature of the education level affect the length of payment delay?

- The categorical plot above shows each education level’s proportion in each month’s repayment status. Samples with graduate school education levels have slightly larger percentages in duly or early payments, and samples with university education levels dominate the portion of delayed payments.

### 3. Which marital status caused payment delay the most?

![Marital Proportion](images/final_plots_Remy/final_plot3.png)

- The categorical plot above shows each marital status’s proportion in each month’s repayment status. The proportion is close to equal in the early payments and still needs more data to determine which marital status has a larger portion in delayed payments.


### 4. How will age determine the length of payment delay?

![Distribution of age](images/final_plots_Remy/final_plot4.png)

- The joint plot above demonstrates the distribution between age and the average number of months clients used to pay back. There are three hex bins that have darker colors which means many samples concentrate at that range, the three hex bins are between ages 20 to a little bit above 30 and these samples delay more than two months for their payments.


#### As result, a sample client profiling as female, graduate school education level, whether married or single, and age not between 20 to 30 can be considered a creditable client because this group tends to pay back their credit card early or duly, and a sample client profiling as male, university education level, whether married or single, and age between 20 to 30 can be considered as an uncreditable client since this group tends to delay their payment under the setting of this dataset.
